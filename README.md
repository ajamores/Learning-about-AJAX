# Learning-about-AJAX

This repository contains the code for a webpage that demonstrates the use of AJAX to retrieve information from a server hosted on Mohawk College and Bootstrap to style the page. The page has two buttons, one that retrieves text information from the server and displays it in the header, and the other that retrieves an array of images and their corresponding information and displays them on the page.

## Technologies Used

    - JavaScript
    - AJAX
    - Bootstrap


## Usage

    - Click the "Learning AJAX" button to retrieve and display text information in the header.
    - Click the "Load Images" button to retrieve an array of images and their corresponding information and display them on the page.

## Code Overview

- The index.html file contains the HTML code for the webpage, which includes two buttons and two containers where the retrieved information will be displayed. The webpage uses Bootstrap classes for styling.

- The script.js file contains the JavaScript code for the webpage. The code uses event listeners to detect when the buttons are clicked and calls functions to retrieve and display information on the page.

- The code uses AJAX to make HTTP requests to a server to retrieve information. When the information is retrieved, it is parsed and inserted into the DOM using JavaScript.
